Now from the kaggle data set we  can team and player attributes.. more about team as a whole

##Player attributes... 
player_api_id : 30981
player_fifa_api_id :158023

## we have to fetch the player attributes for a match using player_api_id

For now I would just say let's take the overall rating./ and average it out for a team
However there are lot more  things which can be considered like pace, vision.. i just think overall rating has everything included
32. Player attribute ..average of all overall rating of players...  



##Team Attributes
There are lot of strings here which we  have to give the integer value to.

buildUpPlaySpeedClass  - Fast -2 slow 1
buildUpPlayDribblingClass Little 1 Normal 2 Lots 3
buildUpPlayPassingClass
"Mixed" 1
"Long" 2
"Short" 3

..more strings are there
But
for now lets just take the integers...  Divide into buulduup , chance creation and defence average

33. Buildup  average  -(Average of attributes buildUpPlaySpeed, buildUpPlayDribbling, buildUpPlayPassing  )
34. chance creation average - (chanceCreationPassing, 	chanceCreationCrossing, chanceCreationShooting)
35. Defense  avg : (defencePressure, defenceAggression, defenceTeamWidth)
